## 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Task 1: Mathematical Reasoning**
Prompt:  
*"Solve this step-by-step: A shopkeeper sells an item at a 20% profit. The cost price of the item is ‚Çπ500. If he offers a discount of 10% on the marked price, what is the selling price?"*

Response (Step-by-step reasoning provided by the model)...

**Task 2: Scenario Reasoning**
Prompt:  
*"Explain step-by-step how an electric vehicle converts stored battery energy into motion."*

Response...

---

## 2. Meta-Prompting

**Task 1:**
Prompt:  
*"You are an expert interviewer. Create a list of 10 advanced-level Python interview questions that test problem-solving and real-world application skills."*

Response...

**Task 2:**
Prompt:  
*"You are a teacher preparing a lesson on climate change for high school students. Create a lesson outline with objectives, activities, and evaluation methods."*

Response...

## 3. Question Refinement

**Task 1:**
Original question: "Tell me about AI."
Refined prompt: "Explain Artificial Intelligence, including its definition, core subfields, and real-world applications, in under 150 words."

**Task 2:**
Original question: "How does a car work?"
Refined prompt: "Explain in simple terms how a petrol car engine works, focusing on fuel combustion, power generation, and movement of the wheels."

## 4. Sandwich Prompting

**Task 1:**
Intro: "You are an experienced financial analyst."  
Core: "Explain the pros and cons of investing in mutual funds for beginners."  
Outro: "Make sure the explanation is clear and includes practical tips."

**Task 2:**
Intro: "You are a skilled career coach."  
Core: "Give advice to a software engineer with 3 years of experience who wants to transition into AI/ML."  
Outro: "Highlight key skills to learn and the most in-demand tools."

---

## 5. Cognitive Verifier Pattern

**Task 1:**
Prompt: "Explain the process of photosynthesis in detail."  
Verifier: "Does your explanation include sunlight, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide?"

**Task 2:**
Prompt: "Describe the functioning of blockchain technology."  
Verifier: "Ensure your explanation covers decentralization, cryptographic security, and transaction verification."

---

## 6. Audience Persona Pattern

**Task 1:**  
Audience: College students studying computer science.  
Prompt: "Explain recursion in programming with a simple Python example."

**Task 2:**  
Audience: Senior citizens curious about the internet.  
Prompt: "Explain what the internet is in a simple, relatable way."

---

## 7. Flipped Interaction Pattern

**Task 1:**  
Prompt: "Before explaining, ask me three questions to understand my knowledge about machine learning."

**Task 2:**  
Prompt: "Before giving career advice, ask me about my skills, interests, and current experience."
